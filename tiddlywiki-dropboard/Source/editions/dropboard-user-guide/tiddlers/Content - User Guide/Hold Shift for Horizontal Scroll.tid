tags: Tips

When the width of all the lists together exceed the width of the board, a horizontal scrollbar appears at the bottom. A convenient way to navigate a wide board is to hold shift while scrolling the mouse wheel to cause horizontal scrolling.

In Chrome shift scroll works by default.

In Firefox shift scroll is used to navigate back and forward in page history. Plugins like [[Shift + Scroll|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shift-scroll/]] work on wikis that are hosted on the internet, but not wikis opened from local files.
