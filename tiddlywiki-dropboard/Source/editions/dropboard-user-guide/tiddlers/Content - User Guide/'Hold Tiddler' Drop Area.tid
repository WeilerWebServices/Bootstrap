title: 'Hold Tiddler' Drop Area
tags: [[Control Banner Drop Areas]]

Drag a card, list, [[or any tiddler|Any Tiddler can be a List or Card]] into the "Hold Tiddler" drop area. A temporary version of that tiddler will remain there as a widget.

This is useful when boards have many lists and cards. You can scroll to a position in a list that is not visible on screen, then drag the card back from the hold area to the desired position.
