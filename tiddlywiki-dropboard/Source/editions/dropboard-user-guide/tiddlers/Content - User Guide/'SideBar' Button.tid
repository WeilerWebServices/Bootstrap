title: 'SideBar' Button
tags: [[Control Banner Widgets]]

The button labeled "SideBar" creates a tab that contains the board in the sidebar.

This also closes the tiddler in the main story, and sets the list width to fit 1.

While the tab exists, the button will change to display an <span class="_-_-img_inline-OV-_C">{{$:/core/images/close-button}}</span> icon. Press it again to delete the tab.
