title: shortid Plugin
tags: [[Tech Talk]]

"<a href="https://github.com/reidgould/tiddlywiki-shortid-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shortid Plugin</a>" is the <a href="https://github.com/dylang/shortid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shortid</a> package bundled using <a href="webpack.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webpack</a> and exposed in TiddlyWiki as a $tw.utils function and as a macro. The entire plugin including util function, macro, license, and attribution is 9 kB.

Dropboard uses this plugin to generate and ID for the "title" field when the [['New Tiddler' Widget]] is dropped onto a card or list. Combined with the [['shorttext' Field]], a very smooth workflow can be accomplished.

The actual ID that is generated for a new tiddler is not important. You are free to change the "title" field to something more meaningful.

Use of "shortid Plugin" is optional. Dropboard works without it even being installed, but be aware that the [['New Tiddler' Widget]] has bugs related to correct placement of the new tiddler when "shortid Plugin" is absent.
