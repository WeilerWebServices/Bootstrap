# Rod's Habit Chart Templates

This directory contains templates for "bubble charts" that you can check-off every day to track your success on introducing a new habit.

The form is available both as Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) files (created with Inkscaple) and as Portable Document Format (PDF) export, suitable for printing.

 * `habit-chart-15x7weeks-letter` - letter-sized (8.5"x11") sheet containing a 15 rows of 49 bubbles (in groups of 7). This could be used, for example, to track 15 habits for 7 weeks.
