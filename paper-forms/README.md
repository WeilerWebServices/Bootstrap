This repository houses a collection of printable forms and templates.

 * [graph paper](https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms/tree/master/graph-paper) - various types of graph paper

 * [habit charts](https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms/tree/master/habits) - bubble charts for tracking habits

 * [lean canvas](https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms/tree/master/lean-canvas) - a worksheet for capturing and exploring early-stage business or product concepts, implementing [Ash Maurya's "Lean Canvas"](http://www.ashmaurya.com/2012/02/why-lean-canvas/).

**On a related note, I recently created a little web-based tool for generating arbitrary graph paper PDFs. There's one for [generating regular "quad" graph-paper](http://noumlaut.com/pnp/make/graph-paper/quad-paper) and another for [generating a hexagonal grid](http://noumlaut.com/pnp/make/graph-paper/hex-paper). You can find the full [index of printable template generators here](http://noumlaut.com/pnp/).**
