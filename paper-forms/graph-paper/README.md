# Rod's Graph Paper Templates

This directory contains templates for printable graph paper sheets in various formats.

These are available both as OpenDocument graphic (ODG) files (created with OpenOffice) and as Portable Document Format (PDF) exports, suitable for printing.

For the record I'll assert these are published under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license (CC BY-SA 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), but it obviously isn't very difficult to re-create these sheets from scratch.
